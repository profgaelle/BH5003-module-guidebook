## Module Summary {-}

This module is one of the options available to students during their work placement/business experience. It allows you to develop your skills and knowledge and learn about the business environment and the world of work, linked to your main interests; in this case, the opportunity to gain experience in research work on one or more business topics under the direction of a Principal Investigator and/or co-investigator(s).
 
The module consists of a period of placement in one of the Faculty’s research units or departments. In this module, you will have the opportunity to use the management skills acquired in your business readiness training and to deepen the conceptual and theoretical knowledge acquired through your study of the core curriculum. During your period of placement, you will be introduced to business research and how research is conducted and used in business and in academia. In addition, you will learn about the skills and knowledge required to become a researcher. 

The module seeks to ensure that you reflect on and develop you research skills with a view to using these skills in your final year (e.g., for a final year Dissertation). Developing an understanding of the added-value of evidence-based practice to inform theory-building is particularly emphasised. You will be expected to attend weekly meetings with a Principal or Co-Investigator on the research project as well as research skills workshops. Placement activities may also include designing surveys, locating and screening research participants, as well as contributing to the overall research environment, and supporting research activities such as the organisation of research events and research development initiatives.

### Module Aims {-}

-	To introduce you to the latest skills and knowledge required to become a researcher;
-	To offer you experience in undertaking research work on a business research topic under the direction of academic researchers;
-	To give you an opportunity to appraise your skills and critically reflect on your personal development.

### Learning Outcomes {-}

On successful completion of the module, you will be able to:

-	carry out systematic literature searches using bibliographic databases and use reference management software to manage articles;
-	construct a research data management plan to support the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research;
-	reason about ethical responsibility in research to suggest and justify a solution to ethically problematic situations;
-	compose an answer to a research question based on a reflective analysis of data;
-	communicate the results of a research project through the design of a poster presentation;
-	appraise their research work performance and development needs.

## Assessment strategy {-}

### Elements of assessment {-}

|DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENT|DEFINITIVE UNISTATS CATEGORIES|PERCENTAGE|
|---|---|:---:|
|Research skills portfolio	| Coursework |	50% |
|Research poster |	Coursework	| 50% |
|		|   |100%|

### Achieving a pass {-}

It IS NOT a requirement that any assessment category is passed separately in order to achieve an overall pass for the module.

### Summative assessments {-}

#### Research poster {-}

Students will design an 800-word A0 Research poster to include a background, methods, results, and discussion sections.

**Submission deadline** Thursday 23 May 2019, 09:00AM. | **Feedback deadline** Thursday 20 June 2019, 09:00AM.

#### Research skills portfolio {-}
Students will develop a 2200-word research portfolio based on (one of) the research project(s) they collaborated on during their research placement. The portfolio will be comprised of (a) an 800-word systematic literature search, (b) an 800-word research plan, (c) a 300-word ethics review, and (d) a 300-word critical appraisal of their research skills and development plan.

**Submission deadline** Thursday 06 June 2019, 09:00AM. | **Feedback deadline** Thursday 04 July 2019, 09:00AM.

`For more details on the assessments, including a brief and the assessment criteria, consult the Assessment & Feedback page on the module CANVAS website.`

### Formative assessment {-}

The content of the workshops and additional exercises on Canvas will be designed around the learning objectives so that students can achieve their full potential as they benefit from explicit formative opportunities for practice and ‘feed forward’ on each and every element of the summative assessments. For example, during the first workshop on tools and methods for reviewing existing research, students will get an opportunity to identify and select relevant work related to a research question and will receive feedback on their search, which should feed forward on the first element of their research portfolio (conduct a systematic literature search).

## Attendance {-}

Due to the experiential nature of the learning on this programme, and the importance of professional development enabling students to develop practical skills, learn from and interact with others, failure to attend may put you at risk of academic failure. Please note that KU Check In is primarily a project of care and support aimed to identify students who are not engaging fully with their studies and might be at risk of not achieving their potential. In order to enable KU Check In to best support you, please notify KUCheck In (<KUCheckIn@kingston.ac.uk>) as soon as possible if you are unable to attend due to ill health or any other reason. If you have any concerns about your attendance, please do contact your Personal Tutor in the first instance.

### Lateness for class – ‘Late’ door policy {-}

Arriving on time is an important professional skill to develop.  You should always time your journey so that you will arrive early for classes and if you know there is likely to be travel disruption, allow additional time. However, we recognise that sometimes unexpected delays can occur and, in most cases, you will be allowed into class after the work has started, but in a controlled manner to reduce interruption to others.  This has been requested by students.  Normally, you will be allowed to enter but please do so quietly and do not disturb the other students.  Sometimes you will be asked to wait quietly outside until there is a natural break in the session, and then the lecturer will allow the late students to enter in a group.  In many cases this will happen 10-15 minutes after class has started, and again 10-15 minutes later (as serious travel disruption can often mean severe delays). In all cases when you are allowed access please enter quietly and take a seat with as little disruption to others as possible.

## Submitting assignments and receiving feedback {-}

Kingston Business School operates a paperless system for the majority of assignments. This has many advantages, particularly for students, and means you can submit your assignment and access your feedback online.

All coursework assignments must be submitted to the module in Canvas before the deadline in your module guide. For the majority of modules there will be no need to supply a hard copy. Your module leader will inform you in advance if you are required to submit a hard copy, for example for review or peer marking in class. Dissertations and projects do normally require both online and hard copy submission as the hard copy presentation is linked to the learning outcomes.

Assignments should be submitted in Word unless you are told otherwise. Do not write your name on the assignment as most of our courses use anonymous marking, facilitated by the Canvas system.
Remember to check the marking guidelines when preparing your assignment, and also to ensure you use your own words, and reference properly.  See sections below regarding referencing, plagiarism, and academic misconduct. Please note all assignments are automatically submitted to the Turnitin plagiarism detection software – the video on the following link is an approachable session on how to avoid plagiarism: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yYf8AihndI   

If you are unable to submit to Canvas due to technical problems, please email the assignment, by the deadline, to the course administrator. If the Canvas system itself is down there will normally be an extension to the deadline, please check online. Please only email to the administrator if there are genuine problems with the system, not as a default – our administrators will be checking whether there have been genuine problems and can refuse to accept email versions. 

Remember to always keep a back-up of your assignment, and your working documents, just in case of problems.

Most of these ‘paperless’ assignments will be marked online and you will receive feedback online through Canvas. Some assignments (such as dissertations) will be submitted on paper and feedback will be given online. In a small number of assignments where online feedback is not possible feedback may be given on printed copies  – your module leader will let you know which system they are using and how you will receive the detailed feedback. 
 
At the start of your module you will receive details of the hand-in dates and the latest date at which you can expect to receive feedback, usually a maximum of 20 working days. Please ensure that you read your feedback carefully, not just your mark. Feedback is designed to help you with future work, including on other modules. If you are unsure about how to make the most of your feedback on a particular assignment, ask to see the module leader. If you are still unsure, or feel you are not making improvements across a range of modules, discuss this with your personal tutor. 

You upload your work in Canvas via the following process:

-	Click on the tile for the Canvas module where the work is to be submitted and select the Assignments menu item
-	Tap on the assignment name
-	Tap on the Submit Assignment button
-	Click on the Choose File button and use the dialog box that pops up to find the file to be uploaded
-	Tick the box that indicates that the work is your own, original work
-	Click the Submit assignment button

For the majority of work you receive your feedback via the following process:

-	Click on the tile for the Canvas module where the work was submitted and select the Assignments menu item
-	Tap on the assignment from the list shown
-	Use the View feedback link to the right of the submitted coursework

## Avoiding plagiarism {-}

The best way to avoid academic misconduct or plagiarism is to use your own words, do not cut and paste from other work, and to ensure that you reference properly the sources you have used in your assignment.  There is help available from the library and online, including a range of videos such as those given below:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yYf8AihndI 
http://www.citethemrightonline.com/basics   

`Note.` By submitting an assignment or sitting an exam you are declaring yourself fit to take the assessment therefore please make sure that if you are unwell you understand our mitigating circumstances process.  The most important thing to do is keep us informed if you are experiencing problems!

## BLASC: Business Law Academic Skills Centre {-}

### What is BLASC? {-}
BLASC is a drop-in service offering students at all levels one-to-one help and advice on the academic skills needed to produce their written coursework. We are staffed by both academics and trained final year students.

### Where is it and when is it open? {-}
BLASC is on the First Floor of the Nightingale Centre (LRC) in the Academic Skills section and is open Monday to Friday from mid-October until the end of the academic year (times vary during non-teaching weeks).  At other times BLASC runs on an appointment basis.

### What help can I get? {-}
We offer feedback on all aspects of academic writing, excluding subject specific content.  In particular, we help with grammar, academic structure, referencing and avoiding plagiarism.  Just bring along a printed draft of your work - not your laptop.

### When should I visit? {-}
ASAP! We look at work from its earliest stages (or even just help analyse the assignment brief). If you visit at the last minute, there may be a queue and you will be allocated a shorter slot than at less busy times. Please note: BLASC’s aim is to help you improve and develop your academic writing; it is not a proof-reading service. 

### Will BLASC make a difference? {-}
Definitely! Research demonstrates that students who regularly use the University’s writing centres improve their marks by an average of one grade.

### What other help can I get with my academic writing? {-}

-	The Academic Writing Canvas site contains a series of straightforward advice pages. If you aren’t automatically enrolled on it, join the site either through My Kingston>Academic Success Centres>BLASC, or [this link](https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/enroll/K6PYGX)
-	There are plenty of excellent books in the LRC Academic Skills section 
-	The University also subscribes to Skills4studycampus, an interactive platform to help further develop your learning. 
-	The LRC Discover desk, also on the first floor of the LRC, offers advice on how to search for sources and reference your work. 

**So, come upstairs and visit the one-stop academic advice area!**
